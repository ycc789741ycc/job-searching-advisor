# Phase 1
## Login
* User create account in the system — **done as own email + password**, no
  external provider. Address verification and password reset are not built
  yet: both need email delivery, which is still undecided.

## Sources Connector
* Jira
* Github
* User upload resume

## LLM Configuration
* Able to setup and connect under user account

## Job Platform for Role Map Analysis
**Changed during implementation.** Glassdoor, Indeed and LinkedIn cannot be
crawled — their terms forbid it, and LinkedIn has litigated it
(`domain_model_review.md` decision 6). Replaced by sources that permit it:

* Public ATS job boards: Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby — driven by the companies a
  user watches
* Career pages carrying schema.org `JobPosting` JSON-LD
* JDs the user pastes, which stay private to them
* A company with none of the above gets `manual` coverage: it says plainly that
  nothing updates automatically, and offers "paste a JD" instead

LinkedIn remains a *profile* connector (the user's own data, via OAuth) in a
later phase — never a market data source.

## Report Generation
* Role map
* Strength

# Phase 2
## Support OAuth login
* Google — with sign-in now owned in `identity`, this is our own OAuth code
  exchange that establishes the account and issues *our* session token, not a
  provider-side toggle.

## Jobs
* Matching job from platform

## Resume
* Auto Generate new resume based on user's uploaded info and selected role

# Phase 3
## Resume
* Interactively help user to modify their resume with chat
